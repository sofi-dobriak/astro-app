I created the design of this app at the GoIT marathon, which was dedicated to introducing me to design. But at that time, I had already decided on my future profession, so I completed it with a desire to write code for this app. And I did it.

But unfortunately, I didn't realize how big it was, so at the time I'm writing this (October 28, 2024), I haven't managed to build the structure using Vite. But I really wanted to write the code to make the app functional.

So I chose the most primitive file structure as a solution. I understand that if I used such a structure at work, I would probably be fired immediately. But on the other hand, this project can be used as an example of "exactly how not to write applications".

So I have, as I dreamed, a functional application and a clear example of poor but very instructive file organization in a project
